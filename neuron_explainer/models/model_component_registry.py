"""
This file contains Enums of three kinds of objects that are common across
LM architectures: weight locations, activation locations, and model dimensions.
The weight locations and activation locations are associated
to tuples of dimensions, to define their standardized shapes. This file is intended to
serve as a source of truth for those standards.

    Coarsely specifies the location of a tensor within a layer. Each of the following is mapped to an
    int, and the ordering is from the beginning of the layer to the end.
    This is to be inferred for a scalar deriver based on information available to it.

    The level of granularity is enough to determine whether one node is upstream of a different node,
    but no more. For example, it doesn't distinguish between attention pre- and post-softmax, but it does
    distinguish between an attention head and the residual stream locations immediately before and after
    the attention layer.

    THESE VALUES ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE SERIALIZED.

    The strategy for inferring the LocationWithinLayer is to check
    (1) the node type of the ScalarDeriver
    (2) the activation location type of the ScalarDeriver (if it corresponds to a raw activation)
    (3) the dst of the ScalarDeriver
    (4) any other information available to the ScalarDeriver.

    Based on any one
    piece of information alone, it may be ambiguous what the location within layer is. For example,
    DerivedScalarType.RESID_POST_ATTN and DerivedScalarType.RESID_POST_MLP both correspond to the same
    node type, but post-attn appears earlier in the layer than post-mlp. So the location within layer
    is left ambiguous after checking the node, but clarified after checking the activation location type.
