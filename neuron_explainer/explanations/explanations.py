    May be transformed to another unit by calibration. When we simulate a neuron, we produce a
    discrete distribution with values in the arbitrary discretized space of the neuron, e.g. 10%
    chance of 0, 70% chance of 1, 20% chance of 2. Which we store as distribution_values =

    the real activation units, we can correspondingly tranform the values of this distribution
    to get a distribution in the units of the neuron. e.g. if the mapping from the discretized space
    to the real activation unit of the neuron is f(x) = x/2, then the distribution becomes 10%
    chance of 0, 70% chance of 0.5, 20% chance of 1. Which we store as distribution_values =
