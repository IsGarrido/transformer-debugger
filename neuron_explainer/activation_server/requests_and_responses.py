"""
Request and response definitions. This file shouldn't contain any functions, other than those
defined on the dataclasses.

Requests to InteractiveModel have two parts: an InferenceRequestSpec, specifying how to
run inference to obtain activations, and a ProcessingRequestSpec, specifying how to process those
activations to obtain derived scalars. An InferenceSubRequest contains information for a single
inference step (forward and optionally also backward pass), and one or more ProcessingRequestSpecs
to process activations from the same inference step. A BatchedRequest contains one or more
InferenceSubRequests, whose inference steps are run in parallel, and whose processing steps are
performed sequentially.

InferenceRequests are analogous to single InferenceSubRequests, and are processed stand-alone rather
than in a batch.

TdbRequests compactly specify the information in InferenceRequestSpec and ProcessingRequestSpec,
with only the degrees of freedom permitted by the TDB UI. TdbRequests are converted to
InferenceSubRequests and ProcessingRequestSpecs in tdb_conversions.py. BatchedTdbRequests are
analogous to BatchedRequests.
